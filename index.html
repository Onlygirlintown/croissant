    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      The creator of the French croissant was neither French nor Turkish; he was
      an Austrian businessman, August Zang (1807 – 1888). From a previous visit
      to Paris, Zang knew of the French love and admiration for Austrian cakes
      and pastries and saw an excellent business opportunity in selling the
      French genuine Austrian pastries. Zang returned to Paris, in the late
      1830’s, complete with the best Austrian pastry chefs he could entice away
      from Vienna, and opened a Viennese bakery in Paris at 93 Rue de Richelieu.
      Rather obviously, the bakery was named the Boulangerie Viennoise.
